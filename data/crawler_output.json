It’s called 'Curious Touch‘ and you can find more info about what it is on the linked website. You could help with the crowdfunding campaign or preorder the game. ❤️‍🔥\n\nSo far it’s available only in German but they’re already trying to finance an English version, too 🥳🙌\nThis is the info for that:\n„Help us expand our vision and make Curious Touch available in English. No need to pre-order the German version or donate any more. We’ve introduced a new reward that lets you pledge for the English version, should it become a reality. In the unlikely event that we don’t reach the goal, you’ll receive the German version instead – a great gift for your favorite German-speaking friend or a unique keepsake for yourself.“\n\nAnd here’s the German original:\n\nIm Crowdfunding vorbestellen unter https://www.startnext.com/HJr\n\nErlebe als eigensinnige Katze oder als neugierige Streichelperson ein tiefsinniges, erotisches Abenteuer. Erforscht zusammen eure ganz eigene Sexualdynamik. In jeder Beziehung gibt es auch Unsicherheiten – rüstet euch mit Superkräften aus und stellt euch euren Erzfeinden. Ihr erkundet, was euch anmacht, spielt damit, Neues auszuprobieren und genießt es, Altbekanntes wiederzuentdecken. Holt euch mit Curious Touch Methoden aus Sexualtherapie, Tantra und der sexpositiven Szene nach Hause."

The menstrual cycle is far more than a biological function—it’s the blueprint of vitality, creativity, and connection for half the population.\n\n🌿 With 12+ years in global menstrual health education + activism and recent certification as a Holistic Hormone and Cycle Coach, I bring expertise in cycle syncing, nutrition, embodiment, perimenopause prep, and pleasure to help people truly appreciate the magic that menstrual cycles can offer.\n\n✨ I'd love to work together to make 2025 a year of transformation and powerful community growth in the face of so much chaos! ✨\n\n🩸LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellekeiser/\n🩸Insta: https://www.instagram.com/danikalifornia009/\n🩸Web: https://dani-health.com/ \n🩸Real time: https://calendly.com/danielle-keiser/chittychat \n\nGet in touch to chat about how we can work together to create soulful, precious experiences for your future participants.\n\n📸 by K.

It’s called 'Curious Touch‘ and you can find more info about what it is on the linked website. You could help with the crowdfunding campaign or preorder the game. ❤️‍🔥\n\nSo far it’s available only in German but they’re already trying to finance an English version, too 🥳🙌\nThis is the info for that:\n„Help us expand our vision and make Curious Touch available in English. No need to pre-order the German version or donate any more. We’ve introduced a new reward that lets you pledge for the English version, should it become a reality. In the unlikely event that we don’t reach the goal, you’ll receive the German version instead – a great gift for your favorite German-speaking friend or a unique keepsake for yourself.“\n\nAnd here’s the German original:\n\nIm Crowdfunding vorbestellen unter https://www.startnext.com/HJr\n\nErlebe als eigensinnige Katze oder als neugierige Streichelperson ein tiefsinniges, erotisches Abenteuer. Erforscht zusammen eure ganz eigene Sexualdynamik. In jeder Beziehung gibt es auch Unsicherheiten – rüstet euch mit Superkräften aus und stellt euch euren Erzfeinden. Ihr erkundet, was euch anmacht, spielt damit, Neues auszuprobieren und genießt es, Altbekanntes wiederzuentdecken. Holt euch mit Curious Touch Methoden aus Sexualtherapie, Tantra und der sexpositiven Szene nach Hause."

Quite a few haven't bought them yet and you only have untill MONDAY 2 December to buy them.(that's next week) Otherwise you will have to buy in general which can be stressful! \n\nWe can't wait to get started with you and all the wonderful ideas for camp this year that we all can create together ❤️‍🔥\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for the first general meeting which is happening on Monday 2 December at 6:30pm South African time .
