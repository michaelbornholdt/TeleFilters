Its a bit more far out, but super chill and quiet. And with public transport you can reach everything quite well. It takes me 40 minutes to get to Alexanderplatz and only 30 minutes to Prenzlauer Berg."

I wont charge extra for it :)\n\nLooking forward to meet you and talk to you soon!\n\nHugs,\nAmanda"
