In 2025, we’re thrilled to bring you two events: a winter burn from March 13–16 at the beloved Schloss Beesenstedt 🏰 and a summer burn in mid-September at our sparkling new treasure 🤫\n\n‼️Yes, we found it: our new home‼️\nOur new location which we will reveal soon is the uncut rough diamond 💎 we’ve spent years searching for! It’s a place full of history. It has trizillion tons of space to realize our wildest dreams. By 2026 the new location will also be winter-ready, so we plan to make it our winter residency. However, we want to show how colourful, creative and wild we are. This is why we are doing our first event in September and we really need you to join forces.\n\nThis project only works if we collaborate like burners do and we are ready to invest a lot of love ❤️ and resources into this project. Soon you will be able to pre-register and start working on whatever project you come up with.\nHere are some teasers before the great reveal. An old prison in the basement?! Check! Rooms even more impressive than Beesenstedt’s ballroom!? Check! A lake?! Check! Light-flooded rooms?! Check! We could go on like forever, or in short: we‘re in love 🥰\n\nWinter is too cold 🥶 and September is too far?!\nWe got you covered. So, what’s a bear 🐻 to do in the meantime? Hibernate for another winter? No way! After much thoughtful discussion and a democratic vote, the majority decided: we’re heading back to Schloss Beesenstedt - our cozy but imperfect den under the big chandeliers.\nYes, the reasons we left haven’t changed. It’s pricey, and not everyone loves the \"plug-and-play\" vibe. We’ve heard those voices, loud and clear. But no other venue gives us the creative freedom to make winter magic quite like Beesenstedt. Sure, we said: it‘s over. We said: „Ciao Cacao“ and „last dance“, but we got an offer we could not refuse.\n\nAnd be honest: who of you never had sex with their ex?\nLet’s work together to make this burn as inclusive as possible.\n Because whether you’re a grizzly 🐻 , a panda 🐼 , or a teddy 🧸 , everyone deserves to experience the Burn’s warmth and joy.  The details: Our membership lottery kicks off in the first weeks of January, so don’t wait—sign up now for your membership. The registration form will remain open until December 31st. One last hurrah in Beesenstedt, and then—onward to new horizons! The adventure is calling, and we can’t wait to share it with all of you. #PawPower is back!",
